# Plan: direct file mirror

Status: implemented as MVP.

The plugin mirrors vault files into one Filen folder and uses IndexedDB as the
last-synced baseline.

## Architecture

```text
LOCAL vault files
   <-> SyncEngine decision table
PREV SYNC state  <- IndexedDB / SyncDb
   <-> SyncEngine decision table
REMOTE Filen folder
```

See `docs/filen-sync-implementation-plan.md` for current architecture.

## Implemented files

| File | Status |
| --- | --- |
| `src/fs-remote.ts` | Filen `RemoteFs`; walk/read/write/delete/version APIs |
| `src/sync-engine.ts` | 3-way compare; push/pull/conflict copy |
| `src/settings.ts` | Saved auth, remote root, device/vault labels |
| `src/db.ts` | Prev-sync IndexedDB store |
| `src/progress-view.ts` | Sync progress UI |
| `src/file-version-modal.ts` | Filen versions UI |

## Decision table target

| Local vs prev | Remote vs prev | Expected |
| --- | --- | --- |
| same | same | skip |
| changed | same | upload local |
| same | changed | download remote |
| missing | same | delete remote |
| same | missing | delete local |
| changed | changed | conflict copy + chosen side |
| new | new | conflict; newer wins |

## Current gaps

- Delete rows in the decision table are not implemented correctly yet.
- Remote overwrite behavior still needs runtime confirmation against Filen SDK.
- Remote walk performs `stat()` per entry; large vault cost unknown.
- Sync runs sequentially.

## Resolved questions

| Question | Current answer |
| --- | --- |
| Sync model | Direct mirror |
| Prev-sync storage | IndexedDB via `localforage` |
| Hash | Local SHA-256 only when metadata changed |
| Root mkdir | Implemented via `getParentUuid()` recursive-ish path ensure |
| Socket | Disabled: `connectToSocket: false` |
